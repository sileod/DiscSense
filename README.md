# DiscSense: Automated Semantic Analysis of Discourse Markers

This is a data/code release accompanying this paper:

- Title: "DiscSense: Automated Semantic Analysis of Discourse Markers"
- Authors: Damien Sileo, Tim Van de Cruys, Camille Pradel and Philippe Muller

# Contents

Discourse markers can be considered as noisy labels for various semantic tasks, such as entailment (y=*therefore*), subjectivity analysis (y=*personally*) or sentiment analysis (y=*sadly*), similarity (y=*similarly*), typicality, (y=*curiously*) ...

DiscSense provides a set of associations between discourse markers and the classes of various tasks.

Unlike previous work on discourse marker semantics, DiscSense was built automatically: we finetuned a BERT model for discourse marker prediction between sentences (using the [Discovery](https://github.com/synapse-developpement/Discovery) dataset) and used the marker prediction between sentences of existing datasets. This allows us to measure associations between the classes of existing datasets and predicted markers. 
Previous work mainly use PDTB discourse relations to characterize discourse markere; here, we use a much broader range of linguistic phenomena, by leveraging the datasets of [DiscEval](<https://github.com/synapse-developpement/DiscEval>), [SentEval](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval) and [GLUE](http://gluebenchmark.com/) evaluation benchmarks.



This repository contains an association table with 2.9k associations.
The following table is a small sample showing the dataset classes available in DiscSense alongside the 2 most associated markers. 
For instance, in the CR dataset, when "sadly" is the most plausible marker beginning a sentence, it has 95.2% chance of being annotated with negative sentiment.
